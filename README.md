# weather_v4_lora
LoRa based weather station

NOTE: the code has not been tested on real hardware - I combined the receiver and transmitter code (turned off LoRa and turned on WiFi) and checked for potential errors. You are installing the firmware at your own risk. However, feedback on functionality and experience will be greatly appreciated to improve future versions.
